# My-LeetCode-journey
I have started leetcode and was pretty inconsistent before due to a few reasons which include:
1. I want to be an embedded software /firmware engineer, so as long as I am proficient in low level coding I don't have to worry about leetcode
2. Concepts like Dynamic Programming, memoisation, recursion are almost never used in the Embedded domain and even the people I worked with have never used those concepts
3. Even the questions under the "Bit Manipulation" use a hash table which I have never seen in Embedded Systems

However, I realized that these are nothing but excuses.
Just because what I do on leetcode does not directly translate into Embedded systems does not mean I should not do it. It is better to work on something which requires me to use my brain rather than mindlessly scrolling through Social media.

Now, the reason why I decided to resume leetcode are:
1. I will be spending time on something productive
2. I will develop better problem solving skills
3. I believe I can see patterns after a while
